## How to run your own tutorial or lesson?

We recommend using our base materials here and adapting them to your setting.  Minimally, you need to create your own shortlinks and URL codes to your version of the materials before running, as the archived materials reference our EACL 2023 instance.

For our tutorial setting in an audience participatory style and approximately 20+ participants and 4 organisers, it was important to:
* limit the number of groups so that each group could present within the session's time limit;
* designate a particular organiser to facilitate virtual participants;
* have live edit access to online documents, to allow participant leads to note take and present.

Other formats might consider:
* Lecture only: use and adapt the lecture materials from the first and seventh segments of the tutorial.
* Experiential only: use and adapt Segments 2-6, which asks participants to read and critique abstracts that bring up common ethical issues in our community.
* Student (Homework) Assignment: curate sources from the accompanying [Ethics Reading List](#erl) that the committee maintains, and ask participants to read and write their reflections on.

**If you run a course, tutorial or other session based on these materials, we'd love to hear from you! Please get in contact with us, and we may also (with your permission) list your course or materials in the [Resource](#r) segment.**

## <a id="i">Introduction</a>

In 2022, the ACL Ethics Committee (AEC) decided to propose to run a tutorial on ethics and its impact on ethics in both authoring and reviewing aspects for the community of CL/NLP scholars and practitioners.  As part of this process, the committee chairs and Luciana Benotti (a member of the committee) put together a the [proposal file](proposal/Ethics_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf) and submitted it to the joint call for tutorial proposals.

The tutorial was eventually accepted to run at [EACL 2023](http://2023.eacl.org) (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2-6 May 2023) on Saturday, 6 May as part of the 1/2-day AM events.  We produced a [teaser](teaser/teaser.mp4) to accompany the [published tutorial abstract](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-tutorials.4/).

The tutorial and its materials* were presented in English.  It was structured as per the proposal, in seven segments, each approximately 30 minutes long.  It was participatory in nature, requiring the audience to work in groups on synthetic problematic abstracts written by the proposers that represent common ethical issues experienced by ethics review chairs.  This required a good facilitator-to-group ratio, to ensure all of the participants had a chance to reflect, contribute and be heard, and for the facilitators to keep the session on track.

We conducted the tutorial in an active classroom style, where participants were self-organized into small groups (in our instance, 2 groups of about 10 participants each), electing leads for subsequent group presentation and worked through the exercises to record their reactions to the materials and identify the issues and conducive outcomes.

## <a id="ts">Tutorial Slides</a>

After introducing the organisers and the format and resources of the tutorial, the first segment featured two lecture segments, both focused on introductory and foundational material on ethics.

The presentation deck for the tutorial lives in a public, shared Google Slides permalink: [http://bit.ly/eacl23-ethics-slides](http://bit.ly/eacl23-ethics-slides) but for posterity, we have also archived forms here in this repository:

* <a href="slides/Understanding Ethics in NLP Authoring and Reviewing – Presentation Deck.pdf">PDF, local copy</a> - created from the Google Slides origin deck
* <a href="slides/Understanding Ethics in NLP Authoring and Reviewing – Presentation Deck.pptx">Microsoft Powerpoint, local copy</a> - created from the Google Slides origin deck

Segment 1A (Slides 6-39) covers the definition and scope of ethics; its origins; virtue, deontological and utilitarian forms of ethics; experiments and policy reactions to ethical violation (Nuremburg Trials and Code, Belmont Report).  _This segment was presented by Karën Fort._

Segment 1B (Slides 40-70) focuses on appropriate use and application, biases and evaluation, covering hypothetical and real instances of ethical problems in recent research (Chicken dilemma, IQ prediction, sexual orientation prediction -- the "Gaydar" paper, and how AI and NLP technology influences people both directly and indirectly.  _This segment was presented by Yulia Tsvetkov._

Segment 7A (Slides 86-99) reprised work from Benotti and Blackburn (2022) [_Ethical Consideration Sections in Natural Language Processing Papers_](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.299/), which examined such written ECS in NLP papers to analyze the issues covered in terms of 1) research benefits, 2) potential harms, and 3) vulnerable groups affected.  It covers the differences between geographical region's reporting of such issues.  _This segment was presented by Luciana Benotti._

The remainder of the slides (Segment 7B) are framing materials to help introduce the tutorial, and set up the abstract critique exercise.  _This segment was presented by Min-Yen Kan and all presenters._

## <a id="a">Activity</a>

The hands-on activity in the tutorial starts with a 5-minute introduction of the activity and a short review of the individual abstracts, which are also described in the slides.  Participants were grouped into random groups, which had to elect a scribe and a presenter.  The scribe serves as a secretariat for typing in the notes from their group; and the presenter is delegated as the person in the group to present the findings to the entire tutorial audience.  Each group was assigned one of the abstracts to read and critique.

The critique of the abstracts is run in two phases.  In the first phase, groups discuss first to prepare a single slide for silent sharing with other groups (Segment 2).  In this second phase (Segment 4), the groups could enlarge their thinking by reflecting on either additional abstracts, the single shared slide from each group, or both.

After both phases were finished, each group presented elements of their findings, with the faciltators structuring and probing for issues and clarity on different aspects.  

### Materials

The activity was run using a scribe document where the organizers communicated information (the abstracts below and the instructions) and solicited the audience's feedback on the overall session.

* <a href="activity/[Template] Understanding Ethics in NLP Authoring and Reviewing — Scribe Document.docx">Template Scribe Document (.docx)</a> - scrubbed

However, for the group activities, we used an editable online presentation deck such that each group could create 1-3 slides (1 slide max in the first phease) in their respective subgroups.  



We provide 6 abstracts below with a gloss of their topical concern.  In our EACL 2023 instance, we ran only the first three, due to the smaller number of participants.

1. [Facial Recognition](abstracts/1.txt)
2. [Social Media Dataset Collection](abstracts/2.txt)
3. [Cost-prohibitive Language Models](abstracts/3.txt)
4. [Language Resource Collection from Protected Groups](abstracts/4.txt)
5. [Multilingual Sentiment and Crowdsourced Annotation](abstracts/5.txt)
6. [Large language model use in healthcare](abstracts/6.txt)


## <a id="r">Resources</a>

* The ACL Ethics Stakeholder Survey - Prior to the tutorial, the AEC also conducted a survey of our ACL stakeholders, to help priortize ethics needs of our community.  This tutorial is a direct result of that mandate.  We will also deposit the full report for the survey and associated presentation slides, to be presented live at ACL (Toronto, Canada) on 11 July 2023.

* The ACL Ethics Reading List - [https://github.com/acl-org/ethics-reading-list](https://github.com/acl-org/ethics-reading-list) - also mentioned in Slide 110

The tutorial (Slide 109) also concluded with a list of faculty courses (by our presenters, certainly there are more out there) that have also taught similar topics.  For expediency we list them directly here:
