## Introduction

In 2022, the ACL ethics committee decided to propose to run a tutorial on ethics and its impact on ethics in both authoring and reviewing aspects for the community of CL/NLP scholars and practitioners.  As part of this process, the committee chairs and Luciana Benotti (a member of the committee) put together a the [proposal file](proposal/Ethics_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf) and submitted it to the joint call for tutorial proposals.

The tutorial was eventually accepted to run at [EACL 2023](http://2023.eacl.org) (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2-6 May 2023) on Saturday, 6 May as part of the 1/2-day AM events.

The tutorial was structured as per the proposal, with 7 segments, each approximately 30 minutes long.
