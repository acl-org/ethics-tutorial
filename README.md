## How to run your own tutorial or lesson?

We recommend using our base materials here and adapting them to your setting.  

For our tutorial setting in an audience participatory style and approximately 20+ participants and 4 organisers, it was important to:
* limit the number of groups so that each group could present within the session's time limit;
* designate particular organisers as those to facilitate virtual participants;
* have live edit access to online documents to allow participant leads to note take and present.

## Introduction

In 2022, the ACL ethics committee decided to propose to run a tutorial on ethics and its impact on ethics in both authoring and reviewing aspects for the community of CL/NLP scholars and practitioners.  As part of this process, the committee chairs and Luciana Benotti (a member of the committee) put together a the [proposal file](proposal/Ethics_Tutorial_Proposal.pdf) and submitted it to the joint call for tutorial proposals.

The tutorial was eventually accepted to run at [EACL 2023](http://2023.eacl.org) (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2-6 May 2023) on Saturday, 6 May as part of the 1/2-day AM events.

The tutorial and its materials were presented in English.  It was structured as per the proposal, in seven segments, each approximately 30 minutes long.  It was participatory in nature, requiring the audience to work in groups on synthetic problematic abstracts that represent common ethical issues experienced by ethics review chairs.

|7. Discussing and Troubleshooting Ethics and Further Resources|Presenters             |

We conducted the tutorial in an active classroom style, where participants were self-organized into small groups (in our instance, 2 groups of about 10 participants each), electing leads for subsequent group presentation and worked through the exercises to record their reactions to the materials and identify the issues and conducive outcomes.
