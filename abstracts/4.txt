In this paper, we present the first language model developed for Fridonian, a regional language spoken in the South-East of Austrafrancia by more than 500,000 people. We detail the collection of the corpus, the creation of the model and its evaluation on basic NLP tasks. The corpus creation itself is an achievement, as it is well-known and documented (Birdoff, 2020) that Fridonian speakers are reluctant to allow the recording of their language, for fear it will be used against them by the country's Sidonian majority. However, we managed to record 100 hours of speech in different settings: family discussions, local authority meetings, ceremonies and traditional storytelling contests. We used this dataset to train a language model which we evaluated on sentiment analysis and named-entity recognition tasks, with impressive results (resp. 0.56 and 0.75 in F-measure). The created language model FridoBERT and the dataset FridoSPEECH are freely available on GitHub.
