Is sentiment analysis dependent on culture or only on language? In this paper we describe the collection and annotation of a billion-word dataset over 7 different Spanish dialects spoken in Latin America, annotated with fine-grained sentiment analysis cues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Latin American dataset currently available. We used data from public groups in Telegram where locals talk about products and services. We evaluate the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models on it,  showing that their performance is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art results on well-known benchmark for Spanish. The dataset annotation took three months. We selected crowdworkers after a careful exam to ensure they were fluent in the target dialect. We paid them 4 US dollars per hour, a fair wage considering it was two times the minimum wage in these countries. Our sentiment classifier fine-tuned per dialect outperforms previous models on Spanish by large margins. Our model has been used for 12 months by hundreds of companies in Latin America. To serve the model, we implemented a costing model to provide this service at a uniform price to all regions of the world. We conducted three usability studies in collaboration with three companies, which demonstrated that the integration of our sentiment analysis detector markedly increased users' engagement with their marketing advertisements.
